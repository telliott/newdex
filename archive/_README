The old dex used to do a lot more. Unclear how much of that is actually used,so let's start clean and go from there.This is all the old code that didn't get ported/rewritten. There's some great stuff in here, so we're keeping it around in the event that we need to refer to it to see how something was done.Most of it won't work, but it's not that far off. Some db changes have happenedthat might cause weirdness (we don't really have boxes in the same way anymore, for example)
