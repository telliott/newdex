* Initial the parts of the packet that you worked on.
* Do not use black pen, there are red pens in the inventory drawer. Put
  them back in the inventory drawer when you're done.
* Mark clearly when a box begins and a box ends, drawing a line between them.
* Write down what box you're in at the tops and bottoms of each page.
* This is like inventory, circle M for books you can't find; if there's
  more than one called for and you can't find all the one called for,
  indicate down clearly how many were missing.  If you belive the book was
  miscatalogued, circle the wavy lines and indicate what should change.  If
  you wish to communicate anything for posterity that doesn't match the
  above, WRITE IT CLEARLY AND WITHOUT ANY ASSUMPTIONS OF SHARED KNOWLEDGE.
  Don't write mysterious, vague things on the sheet; we'll have to hunt you
  down later and figure out what you meant.
